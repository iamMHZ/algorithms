## Greatest Common Divisors

#### Problem Definition

+ Suppose that we have integers `a` and `b`, we need to find the largest integer `d` that divides both `a` and `b`.

+ Findig GCDs is important in Number Theories and Cryptography.
+ GCD finding algorithms must be efficient enough to run on large numbers.

#### Naive Algorithm:

+ It is Slow for large numbers and its running time is approximately `a+b`.
